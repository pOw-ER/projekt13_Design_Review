      <div>
        <p>We will review your designs (website or mobile/web app) and explore where the design works well and where it
          can be improved. We focus our process around one central question: “What can we do to make this design more
          efficient?”</p>

        <h4>A picture is worth a thousand words</h4>
        <p>Unlike any other design review or audit, we will not only tell you what can be improved but also make revamps
          to the most critical parts of the design.</p>
        <h4>Design Report</h4>
        <p>We will evaluate your design based on a variety of parameters and provide a detailed visual report with
          useful tips and design hacks. This would be the starting point for further work on the design.</p>
        <h4>Ways to Redesign</h4>
        <p>We provide several strategies for further redesign by various contractors, from freelancers to high-end
          agencies. We provide you with an assessment of the timing and cost for both a full redesign and quick but
          effective improvements.</p>
